# !! WARNING !!

`cf-extension.css` file in this directory is a prebuilt committed version of legacy
Contentful UI Extension styles.

It is here for backwards compatibility only: it will be packaged and published on npm
so it's available under its legacy URL:

https://unpkg.com/contentful-ui-extensions-sdk@3/dist/cf-extension.css

We can remove it as soon as we reach 4.0.
